# Insurance Fraud Detection Using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project explores the application of regression and ensemble learning techniques—specifically Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting—to detect fraudulent patterns in insurance data. Additionally, advanced feature selection techniques and stacked ensemble models are employed to enhance model performance and generalization.

## Overview

- **Topic**: Experimentation with Regression, Ensemble Learning, and Feature Selection  
- **Bonus**: Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithms, SelectFromModel, and Sequential Feature Selector

## Objectives

- Implement and compare multiple regression models
- Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- Explore model-based and algorithmic feature selection methods
- Apply ensemble learning through stacking
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, R², and Kaggle leaderboard scores

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `xgboost`, `mlxtend`, `deap`
- Scikit-learn based models: DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor
- Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV
- Feature selection: SelectFromModel, SequentialFeatureSelector, GeneticSelectionCV

## Key Concepts

### 1. Regression Models Used
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
